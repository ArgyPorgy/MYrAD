# MYRAD 🚀  
*A decentralized data marketplace for secure and transparent dataset exchange*  

---

## 🌐 Overview  
**MYRAD** is a decentralized data marketplace that empowers creators and consumers to **exchange datasets securely, transparently, and fairly**.  
By converting datasets into **fungible DataCoins** that represent access rights, MYRAD enables:  

- Trustless monetization for data creators  
- Flexible, tradable dataset access rights  
- Transparent, immutable provenance through decentralized storage  

Built on **blockchain verification** and **decentralized storage (Filecoin + Lighthouse)**, MYRAD provides a seamless workflow for dataset sharing, discovery, and monetization.

## ❌ The Problem Today  
Current data sharing ecosystems suffer from:  

- ❌ Lack of transparent and immutable dataset provenance  
- ❌ Limited monetization options for data creators  
- ❌ Centralized marketplaces restricting accessibility  
- ❌ Complex authentication, payment, and access workflows  

---

## ✅ How MYRAD Solves This  
MYRAD introduces a new paradigm for dataset exchange:  

- **🔒 Decentralized Storage & Verification**  
  - Secure dataset uploads via [Lighthouse Storage](https://lighthouse.storage/) anchored on **Filecoin**  
  - Identity verification via **Gmail, Reclaim Protocol, Privy Auth**  

- **💰 Fungible DataCoins**  
  - Each dataset is tokenized into its own **fungible DataCoin**  
  - Represents dataset access rights and can be freely traded  

- **🔄 Token Swap Marketplace**  
  - Buyers acquire DataCoins through integrated **on-chain token swaps**  
  - Smooth, permissionless marketplace transactions  

- **🔥 DataCoin Burning on Download**  
  - To download a dataset, buyers must **burn DataCoins**  
  - Deflationary mechanism → increasing scarcity and long-term token value  

- **📈 Creator-First Revenue Model**  
  - **95%** of swap proceeds go directly to creators  
  - **5%** supports platform sustainability  

- **🛡️ Secure & Transparent Access**  
  - Token-gated downloads from decentralized storage  
  - Fully auditable, on-chain workflows

## 🔑 Key Features  
- ✅ **Fungible DataCoins** (not NFTs) tied to datasets  
- ✅ **Immutable storage** via Lighthouse + Filecoin  
- ✅ **On-chain swaps** for smooth, decentralized trading  
- ✅ **Burn-to-download** mechanism driving token scarcity  
- ✅ **Creator-first monetization** with revenue sharing  
- ✅ **Secure onboarding** with streamlined identity verification

## 🛠️ Workflow  

1. **User Verification** → Authenticate via Gmail, Reclaim Protocol, or Privy Auth  
2. **Dataset Upload** → Store securely on Lighthouse (anchored on Filecoin)  
3. **DataCoin Launch** → Generate fungible DataCoins representing dataset access rights  
4. **Token Swap** → Buyers acquire DataCoins via on-chain swaps  
5. **Burn-to-Download** → DataCoins are burned in exchange for dataset downloads  
6. **Revenue Payout** → Creators receive 95% of proceeds instantly, with on-chain transparency

# System Architecture

MYrAD is built with a **modern, modular architecture** designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## üß± Overview

The system follows a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Frontend (User Interface)**
   - Built with **Next.js (React Framework)**  
   - Real-time updates via **WebSocket connections**  
   - Optimized UI components using **TailwindCSS and ShadCN**  

2. **Backend (API + Logic Layer)**
   - **Node.js / Express** based REST APIs  
   - **Supabase** as the database and authentication provider  
   - Data transformation layer built in **TypeScript** for consistency  

3. **Data Layer**
   - **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)** stores structured data  
   - Analytics models run on **Python microservices** (future integration)
   - Caching handled with **Redis** for fast query response

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **User Interaction:** Frontend sends requests via REST or GraphQL endpoints  
2. **API Gateway:** Routes requests through authentication and authorization middleware  
3. **Business Logic:** Data is validated, processed, and transformed  
4. **Database Layer:** Queries run on Supabase/PostgreSQL  
5. **Response:** Optimized JSON responses are sent back to the frontend

## ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure

- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Supabase (backend + DB)  
- **Monitoring:** Integrated analytics and server logs via Supabase  
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment from GitHub

## üß© Future Enhancements

- Microservices for scalable data processing  
- Machine learning modules for predictive analytics  
- Plugin-based data connectors for enterprise integration

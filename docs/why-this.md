# Why MYRAD

MYRAD transforms how data is owned, priced, and distributed.

### ðŸ”— Why This Approach
Traditional data marketplaces rely on centralized pricing and access systems. MYRAD eliminates the middleman by:
- Tokenizing datasets as **ERC20 DataCoins**
- Using **automated market makers (AMM)** for price discovery
- Enforcing access through **token burning and JWT authorization**

This enables a **trustless**, **transparent**, and **fair** data economy.

### ðŸš€ Why Us
- **Fully decentralized:** No central authority or custodian  
- **Transparent pricing:** Automated liquidity pools define fair value  
- **Creator empowerment:** Data owners earn directly from trades  
- **Security-first design:** OpenZeppelin-audited contracts and JWT-controlled access  
- **Composable infrastructure:** Built for integration with DeFi and Web3 ecosystems

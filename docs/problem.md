# The Problem

In today's data economy, datasets are often **locked behind centralized platforms** or **sold through opaque intermediaries**.  
Creators struggle to monetize their data fairly, while buyers face high costs, limited transparency, and trust issues.

### Key Challenges:
- **Centralized control:** Platforms own and gatekeep access to valuable datasets.  
- **Lack of transparency:** Pricing, access rights, and data provenance are unclear.  
- **Limited monetization:** Creators receive minimal compensation for their data.  
- **Intermediary dependency:** Trust is placed in centralized brokers.  

**MYrAD** addresses this by creating a **permissionless, decentralized marketplace** where datasets are treated as **digital assets** â€” tokenized, tradeable, and verifiable on-chain.
